FAQ: |
  Initially, a "bot" (short for "robot") is a program that automatically,
  on a command or a given schedule performs different actions. Simply put, a program to commit
  routine operations. And he does it through the same interfaces as a regular user,
  as if imitating a real user.

  * Why is a bot better than a "real user"? *
  A bot does a tedious job, not only saves man’s time and energy,
  but does the job at higher speeds.

  Bots have better reaction and accuracy compared to humans - this is used in computer games,
  online auctions, advertising, electronic stock trading and so on. Bots are used to simulate
  human activities, in particular in chat rooms. These are the so-called chat bots.

  Chatbots can be configured to provide adequate answers in human language.
  Of course, provided that he recognizes and supports this kind of team.

  * Well, what are they doing on Telegram? *
  Telegram bots are a type of chatbot. According to the rules, all their names must end with the word "bot".
  At its core, these are the same user accounts that are controlled by programs instead of people.

  They help to carry out different actions: translate and comment, train and test,
  seek and find, ask and answer, play and entertain, broadcast and aggregate,
  integrate into other services and platforms, interact with sensors and things connected to the Internet.
  Telegram bots can be “Add To Group”, or “Share” them.
  And this is far from all the opportunities presented by the platform for their creation.
